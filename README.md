Description: In this module challenge I was tasked with creating a SVG Logo generator built from the command line using Node.js. The challenge featured the npm package "inquirer" along with the fs modules functions like .writeFile() and .sendFile(). The user can customize the shape, color, and text of the logo and it will generate it accordingly.
